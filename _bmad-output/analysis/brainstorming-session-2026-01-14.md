# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Asmit
**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Intern Management System
**Goals:** Review proposed features (Tracking, Offer, Performance), clarify them, and brainstorm additions/enhancements.

### Context Guidance

_Focus on software product development: user problems, feature capabilities, technical approaches, and business value for an Intern Management System._

### Session Setup

**Role:** Hiring Manager (Single User System)
**Constraints:** INTERNAL ONLY. NO student/interviewer access. HM inputs all data.
**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Shortlist Dashboard:** View candidates passing rounds.
2.  **Detailed Tracking:** Per-student info on tests/eliminations.
3.  **Comprehensive Profiles:** Resumes, scores, interviewer reviews, ID docs (Adhar/College ID).
4.  **Offer Automation:** Edit/Send offer letters via email using templates.
5.  **Post-Onboarding:** Performance tracking and task assignment.

**Objective:** "Analyse them and make them clear to me", "do your thing brainstorm features", "review these".

## Technique Execution Results

**Technique: Role Playing (Data Entry Mode)**
- **Insight:** Formatting 50 rows in Excel to import is just as much work as typing them into the app IF the data source is manual.
- **Idea 1:** **Smart Resume Parser** (Upload PDF -> Auto-fill Name, Email, Skills).
- **Idea 2:** **Quick-Add Form** (Optimized for tabbing through fields quickly).

**Technique: Role Playing (Offer Manager Mode)**
- **Insight:** "Send" button anxiety is real. Preview is mandatory.
- **Insight:** Joining Date is standard for the batch. No need for individual date editing, just one "Global Date" setting.
- **Idea 3:** **PDF Live Preview** (See exactly what gets sent).
- **Idea 4:** **Batch Offer Generator** (Set "June 1st" once -> Generate 10 letters).

**Technique: Role Playing (Performance Tracker Mode)**
- **Insight:** Granular task tracking in a single-user system is "double entry" work and won't be used.
- **Decision:** Shift to High-Level Performance Logging.
- **Idea 5:** **Weekly/Monthly Scorecards** (Rating + Notes field).
- **Idea 6:** **Milestone Tracker** (e.g., "Project Delivered", "Training Complete").




## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Intern Management System with focus on feature analysis and expansion

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Six Thinking Hats:** Structured critique to find breaking points (Black Hat) and opportunities (Green/Yellow).
- **Role Playing:** Stakeholder analysis (Intern, Interviewer, Admin) to find missing features.

**AI Rationale:** Selected to provide a rigorous "Review & Expand" workflow as requested.
